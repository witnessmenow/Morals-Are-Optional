All users will connect to the game using any devices browser.\r\n* **No Dedicated Screen** - One player will launch the app (Android or PC) and then connect to game using their devices own web browser. All other players will connect to the game using any devices browser. In this setup there will be no main screen, but it is not required.\r\n* **External Dedicated Screen** - Setup the game the same as the \"No Dedicated Screen\" setup. Then using a device you want to display the main screen on connect to the app and chose the \"table\" screen. This works well on smart TVs or something like that.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
